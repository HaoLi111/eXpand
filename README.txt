# Code snipnet for expanding 3d surfaces to a 2d projection


- maybe useful for building models of complicated 3d forms by folding 2d papers/ foamboards or cardboards.
- to expand either manually specify expanding bases and directions (input 2d or 3d faces)
- or, use an expansion logic to expand a sequence of surfaces
- experimental, no warranty
